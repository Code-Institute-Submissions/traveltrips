# README FILE

## navbar:

Used these links to style the navbar with Bootstrap:
https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/navbar-logo/
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/


### logo:

I made the logo on:
https://secure.logomaker.com

### modal:
The cta on the mainpage is a button that says "book now". When you click on it a modal pops up.
The basics of this Modal (with form) are styled with Bootstrap:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/ ~ form

## footer
Code from the mini project "make your own cv" of the Code Instituut was the basic inspiration for the footer.
to make it a bit more interactive I used:
https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/ to give a delay in the color change when you hover over one of the links in the footer.
To make the email clickable I used https://www.handleidinghtml.nl/html/hyperlinks/hyperlinks09.html as inspiration.
To make the phone number clickable I used https://webdev-il.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-to-make-html-link-to-call-phone.html as inspiration.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
